# Q-Quest Quantum Oracle

> Human-Centric Quantum Philosophy  
> Connecting People Through Quantum-Enhanced Destiny

## Project Overview

**Q-Quest Quantum Oracle** is a value experience project that expresses the traditional Japanese concept of "En" (縁 - connection/destiny) through QUBO (Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization) technology.

### Vision

- Launch **Human-Centric Quantum Philosophy** as a new trend from Japan to the world
- Create connections between people through quantum technology
- Serve as a cultural bridge, providing value experiences for the next generation
- Re-examine Japanese culture and present it to the world
- Leverage aspects of Japan that international audiences find appealing

## Concept

### Quantum Oracle (量子神託)

A modern reinterpretation of traditional "omikuji" (fortune slips) using quantum technology. Analyzes the user's "emotional state" and suggests optimal "connections" through QUBO algorithms.

### Core Elements

1. **Quantization of "En" (縁)**: Modeling connections between people, places, and experiences using QUBO
2. **Mood Estimation**: Inferring emotional state from text input and dynamically adjusting QUBO parameters
3. **Quantum Omikuji**: Probabilistic "oracle" presentation using Boltzmann distribution
4. **Japanese Cultural Elements**: Experience design using seasons, haiku-like phrases, and Zen wisdom

## Technical Stack

- Python 3.x
- NumPy (numerical computation)
- Matplotlib (visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook (experimentation & prototyping)

## Quick Start

### Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook

### Setup

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook notebooks/Q_QUEST_量子神託.ipynb
```

## Features

### 1. Basic Demo (Cell 0)
- Modeling "En" using QUBO
- Energy landscape visualization
- Network visualization of connections
- Quantum omikuji generation

### 2. Interactive Quantum Oracle (Cell 2)
- Text input for user's concerns/feelings
- Automatic estimation of emotional state (Mood)
- Dynamic adjustment of QUBO parameters
- Personalized "En" suggestions

## Cultural Background

### Japanese Elements We Want to Share

1. **"En" (縁) Concept**: The invisible connections between people
2. **Omikuji Tradition**: The practice of fortune-telling at shrines
3. **Seasonal Awareness (Kigo)**: Sensitivity to seasons as seen in haiku
4. **Aesthetics of "Ma" (間)**: Valuing "negative space" and "detours"
5. **Zen Wisdom**: Phrases like "It's okay not to decide. Postponement is a legitimate choice."

### Sharing with the World

By expressing these elements through quantum technology, we present Japanese cultural values in a new form to the world.
